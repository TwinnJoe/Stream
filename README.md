# 🎬 Stream

**Stream** is a demo movie and series platform built as part of my personal development journey. The goal of this project is to **demonstrate my practical skills in frontend and familiarity with full-stack web development**, especially in creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces.

This project simulates a real-world streaming website where users can register, log in, and access movies or series to stream or download — **entirely free**. It’s not intended for production use but to showcase what I can build as a developer.

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As a frontend developer in training, I created **Stream** to sharpen my ability to:
- Design intuitive user interfaces
- Implement full authentication flows (register, login, logout)
- Connect frontend to a working backend
- Handle dynamic UI behaviors using vanilla JavaScript
- Work with real databases and APIs in a structured manner

This project represents **my understanding of complete application flow**, from UI to backend to database, all while keeping user experience in focus.
